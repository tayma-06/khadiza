## 🧑‍💻 More About Me
- 🤔 **What motivates me:** Failing.
- 📚 **Coding Habits:** I like to **dry run** a problem first before jumping into the implementation phase. Planning and breaking things down before starting helps me approach problems with a clear and structured mindset.

## 🎯 Achievements and Learning Journey
- 🖥️ **Favorite Tool:** I love using **VSCode**. It’s lightweight, customizable, and packed with features that make coding much smoother.
- 💡 **Biggest Challenge:** Learning to teach myself. It’s definitely a challenge to stay consistent and navigate new topics without guidance, but it’s also been a rewarding experience.
- 🌱 **Future Goals:** Will learn everyday. The learning never stops!
